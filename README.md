# Description
This is a simple chrome extension which intends to allow users to record simple sequences of clicks, and play them back. I started this project because I thought it would be useful in my personal finance workflow by allowing me to download my bank transaction CSVs faster.

# Roadmap
* Allow users to store multiple recordings, and reference them by name
* Allow recordings to include text input
* Allow users to view/edit recordings
* Allow users to add delays
* Allow text input to include basic variables (primarily the current date)
